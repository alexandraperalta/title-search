## To install
The client and server were implemented separately. In order to run, you'll have to run `npm install`
in both the client and server folders, as well as the main project folder.

After that an `npm start` at the project root should open the project.

## Should all else fail
Just run `npm start` separately in both folders.
Given time I would refactor this project so it would run on one install/run command.
